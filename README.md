# About the program

The Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows program is a paid, full-time summer internship opportunity for Bryn Mawr students to learn digital research and publication methods and gain professional experience by collaborating on a public-facing digital scholarship project. Over the course of ten weeks, we will explore key issues and methods in digital scholarship, critical making, and multi-modal research through a combination of hands-on work, instruction, and discussion. Fellows will also have opportunities to present their work, create a personal digital portfolio, and learn about careers in libraries, museums, and digital media and research.

## Project: Text Mining the *The College News*
The digital collection of *The College News*, a Bryn Mawr student publication that ran from 1914 to 1968, offers a rich resource for studying college history over a crucial period of social change. This project seeks to explore that history at scale by analyzing the College News collection as a dataset, using computational text analysis, randomized reading, and critical data visualization. By quickly extracting names, places, terms, and ideas from a large body of text, computational methods can help reveal unexpected patterns and surface marginalized histories that can help our community understand and reckon with our past.
