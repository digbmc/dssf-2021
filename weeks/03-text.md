### AM: Python Practice & Web Scraping

#### Python warm-up
1. Write a program that will individually greet each member of our team
2. Use `sleep()` to pause at least 1 second between each name (hint: if you don't know what it does, google it!)
3. Write a program that will randomly greet someone on our team (hint: `randint()` is your friend.)
4. Challenge: how would you write a program that would return the text of a random issue of *The College News*
   
#### Goal: Collaborate on a program to scrape *The College News*
- Pseudocode: what exactly do we need to do to get the data?
- What output do we want?
- What information and tools can we use to get it?
- Problem-solving
