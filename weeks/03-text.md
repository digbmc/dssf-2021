### AM: Python Practice & Web Scraping

#### Python warm-up
1. Write a program that will individually greet each member of our team
2. Use `sleep()` to pause at least 1 second between each name (hint: if you don't know what it does, google it!)
3. Write a program that will randomly greet someone on our team (hint: `randint()` is your friend.)
4. Challenge: how would you write a program that would return the text of a random issue of *The College News*
   
#### Goal: Collaborate on a program to scrape *The College News*
- Pseudocode: what exactly do we need to do to get the data?
- What output do we want?
- What information and tools can we use to get it?
- Problem-solving

### PM: on your own 

#### Intro to Text Analysis
- Read through ["Text Analysis: More than Just Words", Kirsten Bussiere](https://carletonu.pressbooks.pub/digh5000/chapter/chapter-4-text-analysis/)
- Complete exercises using [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/) - 
- Choose one Voyant visualization that you find interesting: export an image and add it to your log

#### Reading/viewing/listening to resources on AI & bias in technology

*Alice out in PM*

### 5:00 Optional Zoom Talk: Marisa Parham, "Black expressive traditions, digital humanities, and electronic literature" - [register here to attend](http://bit.ly/DreamLab21Keynote)

### 9:00 Check-in

### [Natural Language Toolkit Workshop](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/text-analysis/)

1. Set up with Jupyter Notebooks for workshop - standard interface
   1. In terminal, navigate to your folder for python practice
   2. Create a new folder and call it `nltk`
   3. Launch the jupyter notebook browser interface:  `jupyter notebook`
   4. Create a new python3 notebook (use the 'new' button's dropdown menu) & give it a name like "intro-nltk" 
2. Take a look at [this Jupyter Notebooks overview](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/insights/short-introduction-to-jupyter-notebooks/) to get familiar with the platform
   -  **NB** the instructions for opening a notebook are different because most of you don't have the Anaconda Navigator -- instead use my instructions above. 
   -  If you prefer, you can instead create and use [jupyter notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks)
3. Begin the tutorial on your own
   1. Begin by reading & taking notes on the first few sections of [the workshop](https://curriculum.dhinstitutes.org/workshops/text-analysis/) (sections 0-2), and complete the setup instructions in section 3.
   2. If you have time and feel confident you may start section 4; we'll go through that together at 10:15.

### PM
- Finish NLTK tutorial
- Use NLTK, Voyant and other [tools & resources](../resources/text-analysis.md) to explore project data
- Add ideas to the Brainstorming Document:
  - At least one idea for a full-corpus visualization
  - At least one other idea (other than your individual project)

### 3:00 Project Meeting
- Project work next steps
- Visualization and analysis ideas & methods
