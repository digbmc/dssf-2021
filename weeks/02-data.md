### On your own
- Look over [Bryn Mawr History Projects](https://www.brynmawr.edu/about/history/bryn-mawr-history-projects), some of which have DSSF ties!
  - The 2017 cohort produced a [data visualization](https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/dssf17/index.html) of the [College Women](https://collegewomen.org/about) project
  - The 2018 cohort worked on the [Women in Science](https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/howis/) project
  - The 2020 cohort  worked on the ['24 '31 Students Study Race](https://digitalscholarship.brynmawr.edu/howis/) project
- Familiarize yourself with the [Bryn Mawr College Histories Research Guide](https://guides.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/c.php?g=959561)

### 10:00 Intro to BMC Archives - Allison Mills, College Archivist
On Zoom (link in invite)

### PM - Python: Web Scraping
Where possible, adapt the exercises in these tutorials to explore and manipulate The College News data.
- [Downloading web pages with Python](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/working-with-web-pages)
- [Downloading using query strings](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/downloading-multiple-records-using-query-strings)
- [Intro to the Beautiful Soup library](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup)

Think about:
- How are [College News](https://digitalcollections.tricolib.brynmawr.edu/collections/bryn-mawr-college-news) entries recorded in the digital collections? What is the page "architecture" for each entry?
- What metadata exists for each item?  Do you think that some types of metadata will be more important than others for our project?
- If we wanted to download or make a record of each College News item in digital collections using Python, how might we go about doing this? (Start small - thinking about what is needed for just one item - and then expand).

Write your observations in your log.
